# Pytorch Requirement Document

### Memo

The general Learning Objective (LO) of this class is:

1) be familiar with the general offering of pytorch
2) gain expertise of data preprocessing, scalibilities and how to deal with big data and enjoy parallel preprocessing (optional)
3) can perform neural network study end-to-end, disregard of the type of learning methodology and type of data.

case study:

art style mimicing using CNN (or GAN depending on lecturer's mood)
Learning Jazz with GAN 

### Lectures
Class 1 - (class already done, feedback only)

feedback:

- 【授课内容】

discussion on prep course plan
discussion on basic setup of pytorch
discussion on why pytorch and GPU centered network training

- 【课堂表现】

quick understanding of the material and learning objective.
move through mateirals quickly.

- 【问题汇总及解决方案】

discussion on preparation of next class

- [ ] env setup for pytorch
- [ ] virtual env
- [ ] git
- [ ] project planning
- [ ] understand priority and MVP



- 【课后作业】

NA

Class 2 - LO1 and LO2

- type of data discussion

    - Computer Science Data Structure and data types
    - Data Science Data Structure and data types

- discussion with example

    - relational data discussion

        use media log level data (billions of data points per day generated) to learn about the general idea of data.
    - Text Data (twitter data)
    - Image Data (scrapper)
    - Sound Data (if we get to that)

Class 3 - LO2 and LO3

- learn by example: Mimic Artstyle using Deep learning Networt

we will look at an interesting application where we apply a trained network to reimagine the ordinary pictures or drawings. we will look at how those netowrk works and why the learning strategy is important to such application. 

Class 4 - LO2 and LO3

- learn by example: Learn Jazz and trick the jazz masters

we will look at a case to use GAN to learn jazz and create "jazz" pieces, I am a musician myself so let's see if the student's work can trick me to not be able to distinguish jazz pieces from the AI masterwork!
